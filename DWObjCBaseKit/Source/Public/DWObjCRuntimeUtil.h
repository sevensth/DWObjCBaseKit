/**
 * Hooks an instance method of a class.
 * @param cls The class that respons to the given selector.
 * @param select The select you want to hook.
 * @param block The block that will be called when the hooked method being called. It should be defined inline if you want to call origin IMP. Its signature should
 *  be: method_return_type ^(__unsafe_unretained id this, method_args...). The selector is not available as a parameter to this block. The __unsafe_unretained mark is necessary if you don't want the runtime to retain the 'self' before calling the block, so as any other method args of object type.
 * For example:
 * @code
 * //Hooking a method like this:
 * -(NSUInteger)[DemoClass lengthOfString:(NSString *)str]
 * //Will be write as:
 * DWClassHookInstanceMethod(DemoClass, @selector(lengthOfString:), ^NSUInteger(__unsafe_unretained id this, NSString *str) {
 *     //do what you want and optionally call original at some point
 *     return DWClassHookedMethodCallOrigin(NSUInteger, _self, str);
 * }
 * @endcode
